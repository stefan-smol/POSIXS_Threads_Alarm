# README for New Alarm Mutex Program

Welcome to the New Alarm Mutex Program! This guide provides step-by-step instructions to ensure proper setup and execution of the program on your system.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, it is essential to have the correct permissions to execute the Makefile, which is vital for compiling and running the program.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Navigating to the Program Directory**

   Before setting execution permissions, navigate to the directory containing `new_alarm_mutex.c` and the `Makefile`.

2. **Setting Execution Permissions for the Makefile**

   To allow the Makefile to be executed, run the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   chmod +x Makefile
   ```
   This command modifies the Makefile's permissions, enabling its execution.

## Running the Program

1. **Compiling the Program**

   With execution permissions set, you can now compile `new_alarm_mutex.c`. Execute the following command:
   ```
   make
   ```
   This will compile and execute the program.

2. **Exiting the Program**

   To safely exit the program, use the keyboard shortcut:
   ```
   Ctrl + D
   ```
   This command will terminate the program and return you to the terminal.
