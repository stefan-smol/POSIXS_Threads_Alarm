/* Tests Performed */


1. Test creating new alarm.
    Sample input:
        Start_Alarm(1000): 10 ten-second alarm

    Intended behaviour:
        The request is legal and therefore will be inserted into the alarm list.
        Then message will be printed in the following format “Alarm( <alarm_id>) Inserted by Main Thread <thread-id> Into Alarm List at <insert_time>: <time message>".
        Currently there are no display alarm thread for the Alarm_Time_Group_Number associated with the alarm existsing in the system.
        The main thread will create a new display alarm thread for the specified Alarm_Time_Group_Number (in this case the gorup number is ceil(10/5) = 2).
        It will output message in the following format “Created New Display Alarm Thread <thread-id> for Alarm_Time_Group_Number <Alarm_Time_Group_Number> to Display Alarm(<alarm_id>) at <create_time>: <time message>”.
        Every 10 seconds, the thread will print the message in the following format: “Alarm (<alarm_id>) Printed by Alarm Thread <thread-id> > for Alarm_Time_Group_Number <Alarm_Time_Group_Number> at <time>: <time message> ”.

2. Test creating new alarm.
    Sample input:
        Start_Alarm(1000): 11 eleven-second alarm
        Start_Alarm(1001): 14 fourteen-second alarm
        Start_Alarm(1002): 2 two-second alarm
        Start_Alarm(1003): 4 four-second alarm
        Start_Alarm(1004): 9 nine-second alarm

    Intended behaviour:
        The request is legal and therefore will be inserted into the alarm list.
        After each insertion the message will be printed in the following format “Alarm( <alarm_id>) Inserted by Main Thread <thread-id> Into Alarm List at <insert_time>: <time message>".
        After first alarm creation, there are no display alarm thread for the Alarm_Time_Group_Number associated with the alarm existsing in the system.
        The main thread will create a new display alarm thread for the specified Alarm_Time_Group_Number (in this case the gorup number is ceil(11/5) = 3).
        It will output message in the following format “Created New Display Alarm Thread <thread-id> for Alarm_Time_Group_Number <Alarm_Time_Group_Number> to Display Alarm(<alarm_id>) at <create_time>: <time message>”.
        After second alarm creation and onward, there is already a display alarm thread for the Alarm_Time_Group_Number associated with the alarm existsing in the system.
        Every Time seconds, the thread will print the messages in the following format: “Alarm (<alarm_id>) Printed by Alarm Thread <thread-id> > for Alarm_Time_Group_Number <Alarm_Time_Group_Number> at <time>: <time message> ”.

3. Test cancelling an existing alarm.
    Sample input:
        Start_Alarm(1001): 6 six-second alarm
        Cancel_Alarm(1001)

    Intended behaviour:
        There exists the alarm with id = 1001, therefore the program is expected to print a message in the following format "Alarm(<alarm_id>) Canceled at <cancel_time>: <time message>”.
        Since there are no other alarms having same Alarm_Time_Group_Number as the cancelled alarm (it was the only alarm in the alarm list), the main thread will terminate the display alarm thread associated with that Alarm_Time_Group_Number and will output in the following format “Display Alarm Thread <thread-id> for Alarm_Time_Group_Number <Alarm_Time_Group_Number> Terminated at <cancel_time>”, and will no longer display updated about the alarm.

    Produced output:
        Alarm(1001) Inserted by Main Thread 140704655504576 Into Alarm List at 1699918064: 6 six-second alarm
        Created New Display Alarm Thread 123145421479936 for Alarm_Time_Group_Number 2 to Display Alarm(1001) at 1699918064: 6 six-second alarm

        Display Alarm Thread for Alarm_Time_Group_Number 2 Terminated at 1699918074



4. Test cancelling non-existent alarm.
    Sample input:
        Cancel_Alarm(1002)

    Intended behaviour:
        Because there are no active allarm with id of 1002, some meaningful message is printed to the console.

    Produced output:
        Cancel_Alarm: No alarm found with ID 1002.


5. Test replacing an existing alarm.
    Sample input:
        Start_Alarm(1011): 11 eleven-second alarm
        Replace_Alarm(1011): 2 replaced eleven-second alarm with two-second alarm
    Intended behaviour:
        There exists the alarm with id = 1011, therefore the program is expected to loop through the linked list to find this alarm, 
        and change the time and message values to the corresponding inputs, 
        then finally print a message in the following format "Alarm(<alarm_id>) Replaced at <replace_time>: <time message>”.
        
    Produced output:
        Alarm(1011) Inserted by Main Thread 140704655504576 Into Alarm List at 1699933583: 11 eleven-second alarm

6. Test cancelling non-existent alarm.
    Sample input:
        Cancel_Alarm(1002)

    Intended behaviour:
        Because there are no active allarm with id of 1002, some meaningful message is printed to the console.

    Produced output:
        Cancel_Alarm: No alarm found with ID 1002.
